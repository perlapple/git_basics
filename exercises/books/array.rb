#Write a program that iterates over an array and builds a new array that is the result of incrementing each value in the original array
#by a value of 2. You should have two arrays at the end of this program,
#The original array and the new array you've created. Print both arrays to the screen using the p method instead of puts.


array = [1,2,3,4,5]
array2 = array.map { |num| num * 2 }

p "array: #{array}"
p "array: #{array2}"
